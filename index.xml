      <description>Most of our class has been using R as our main source of coding, but here’s a little bit of Python we’ve recently learned!
list1=[1,2,3,4] list1 ## [1, 2, 3, 4] list2=[&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;b&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;] list2 ## [&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;] list3=list1+list2 list3 ## [1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;#39;a&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;b&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;c&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;] We can also use Reticulate to combine Python and R and have them interact together!
library(reticulate) hi&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; hi=&amp;quot;world&amp;quot; print(r.hi,hi) ## Hello world cat(c(hi,py$hi)) ## Hello world While this python code is very remedial, I actually took computer science many years ago in high school and became quite good at the language (at the time!</description>

      <description>Worldwide Mental Health Statistics  Introduction The two datasets I’m joining together are from the same study, and contain informtaion on mental health statistics throughout the world from 1990-2017.
