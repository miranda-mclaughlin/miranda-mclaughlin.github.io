Most of our class has been using R as our main source of coding, but here's a little bit of Python we've recently learned!
```{python}
list1=[1,2,3,4]
list1
list2=['a','b','c','d']
list2
list3=list1+list2
list3
```



We can also use Reticulate to combine Python and R and have them interact together!

```{R}
library(reticulate)
hi<-"Hello"
```

```{python}
hi="world"
print(r.hi,hi)
```

```{R}
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
```

While this python code is very remedial, I actually took computer science many years ago in high school and became quite good at the language (at the time!). I was able to make things like complete websites from scratch, Hangman games, Candy Crush games, and my own map of The Land of Oz!
